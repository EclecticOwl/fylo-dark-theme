## My process

I decided to go with a mobile first approach for this challenge. I also decided to break the components down by section and style while creating them (header, main, footer). This process seemed to help both mentally and seemed to save a few hours.

### Built with
- SASS
- HTML

### What I learned

I have started using more utility classes in order to save time. I tend to use flex a lot, so using a utility class saves time in writing the same code, over and over again.
